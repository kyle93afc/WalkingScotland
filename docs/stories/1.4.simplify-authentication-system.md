## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Story 1.1 Context:** Backend functions for walk data are fully implemented and tested.  
**Story 1.2 Context:** Component imports and field references are corrected for proper data display.  
**Story 1.3 Context:** Mock data has been replaced with live database connections, providing real-time walk information and user interactions.

### Data Models
**User Data Preservation** [Source: architecture.md#data-models-and-schema-changes]
- `users` table synced from Clerk contains walking-specific user information
- `user_stats` table tracks comprehensive walking achievements and metrics
- `walk_reports` table contains user-generated content tied to user accounts
- All user data must remain intact during authentication simplification

**Authentication Integration** [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack-alignment]
- Clerk v6.24.0 handles authentication via middleware.ts
- JWT tokens configured with "convex" template in Clerk dashboard
- Users synced to Convex via webhooks at `/api/clerk-users-webhook`
- Preserve core authentication while removing billing complexity

### API Specifications
**Clerk Integration Patterns** [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack-alignment]
- Maintain JWT integration with Convex through existing configuration
- Preserve webhook events: `user.created`, `user.updated`, `user.deleted`
- Remove `paymentAttempt.updated` webhook events from billing system
- Keep existing `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` patterns for user identification

**Convex Authentication** [Source: architecture.md#security-integration]
- User-based access control through Convex functions with established patterns
- Authentication context from `useAuth()` (Clerk) continues functioning
- Preserve existing session management and data isolation

### Component Specifications
**Dashboard Transformation** [Source: architecture.md#source-tree-integration]
- **Current Location:** `app/dashboard/` with payment-gated subdirectory
- **Target State:** Walking-focused user features replacing subscription management
- **Components to Remove:** ClerkBillingGate, custom-clerk-pricing.tsx
- **Components to Transform:** Dashboard sections to show walking statistics and achievements

**Authentication Flow** [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack-alignment]
- **Current State:** Clerk handles authentication with billing integration
- **Target State:** Simplified user management focused on walking preferences
- **Protected Routes:** Continue redirecting unauthenticated users to sign-in
- **Middleware:** Preserve authentication protection, remove billing checks

### File Locations
**Billing Component Removal** [Source: architecture.md#source-tree-integration]
- `components/custom-clerk-pricing.tsx` - Remove entirely
- `app/dashboard/payment-gated/` - Replace with walking features
- `middleware.ts` - Remove billing route protection, keep authentication
- `package.json` - Remove Clerk Billing dependencies

**Authentication Configuration** [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack-alignment]
- `convex/auth.config.ts` - Preserve JWT configuration
- `convex/http.ts` - Update webhook handlers to remove payment events
- `/api/clerk-users-webhook` - Maintain user sync, remove payment processing

### Testing Requirements
**Authentication Testing** [Source: architecture.md#security-integration]
- **Existing Security Tests:** Convex function authentication validation and Clerk session management
- **New Requirements:** Verify authentication flows remain intact during Clerk simplification
- **User Session Testing:** Confirm existing users can still log in and access walking data
- **Data Integrity:** Validate walking-specific user features continue functioning properly

**Integration Testing** [Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]
- **Authentication Changes:** Test that authentication changes don't break existing user sessions
- **User Data Preservation:** Ensure all existing user accounts and walking data remain accessible
- **Dashboard Functionality:** Verify transformed dashboard displays walking statistics correctly

### Technical Constraints
**Clerk Integration Preservation** [Source: architecture.md#compatibility-requirements]
- Current Convex/Clerk integration must be preserved while removing billing features
- JWT token configuration and webhook sync must continue working
- User authentication and session management must remain stable

**Data Preservation Requirements** [Source: architecture.md#compatibility-requirements]
- Existing database schema must remain intact during authentication changes
- All existing user data, walks, reports, and statistics remain accessible
- User sessions must continue working without requiring re-authentication

**Performance Considerations** [Source: architecture.md#enhancement-scope-and-integration-strategy]
- Authentication changes must not break existing user sessions or data integrity
- Simplified authentication should improve user experience without performance penalty
- Dashboard transformation should maintain responsive performance

### Security Rules
**Authentication Security** [Source: architecture.md#security-integration]
- **Existing Measures:** Clerk JWT authentication with Convex integration
- **Preservation:** User-based access control, data protection, session security
- **Simplification:** Remove billing security without compromising core authentication
- **Compliance:** Maintain GDPR compliance through Clerk user management

**Data Access Control** [Source: architecture.md#security-integration]
- Preserve existing component security boundaries during authentication changes
- Maintain established `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` patterns for user data access
- Ensure simplified authentication doesn't expose unauthorized user data

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]
- **Location:** Follow established test file organization for authentication components
- **Test Standards:** Component-level testing for dashboard transformation and user flows
- **Testing Framework:** Next.js testing environment with authentication testing patterns
- **Security Testing:** 
  - Verify authentication flows remain intact during Clerk simplification (AC: 4, 5)
  - Test existing user sessions continue working during authentication changes
  - Validate user data preservation during billing component removal
- **Specific Requirements:**
  - Test existing user login sessions remain valid (Subtask 5.1)
  - Verify walk reports and user data are preserved (Subtask 5.2) 
  - Ensure user statistics tracking continues working (Subtask 5.3)
  - Test Convex user sync functions properly (Subtask 5.4)
