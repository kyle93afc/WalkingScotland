# Story 1.1: Implement Missing Convex Backend Functions

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to create the missing Convex functions that UI components are trying to call,
**so that** database queries work properly and components can display real data instead of failing silently.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create `walkStages.getStagesByWalkId` function in convex/walkStages.ts matching existing schema
2. Create `walkReports.getReportsByWalk` function with proper indexing and filtering
3. Implement proper TypeScript types for all new function return values
4. Add error handling and loading states for all new database queries
5. Test functions directly in Convex dashboard before UI integration

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Create walkStages.getStagesByWalkId function (AC: 1, 3, 4)
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Review existing walkStages schema in convex/schema.ts
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Create getStagesByWalkId function with proper query structure

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in the epic - no previous story context available.

### Data Models
**Walk Stages Schema** [Source: architecture.md#data-models-and-schema-changes]
- Existing `walk_stages` table contains step-by-step walking directions and waypoints
- Schema is already walking-optimized and comprehensive
- No schema modifications required - functions must work with existing structure

**Walk Reports Schema** [Source: architecture.md#data-models-and-schema-changes]  
- Existing `walk_reports` table contains user-generated content and ratings
- Comprehensive user feedback system already in place
- Field reference must align with existing `walk.averageRating` field name [Source: architecture.md#identified-constraints]

### API Specifications
**Convex Function Patterns** [Source: architecture.md#coding-standards-and-conventions]
- Use existing `useQuery` and `useMutation` patterns established in codebase
- Maintain existing signatures - no breaking changes allowed [Source: architecture.md#critical-integration-rules]
- Functions `walkStages.getStagesByWalkId` and `walkReports.getReportsByWalk` are referenced as existing but need implementation [Source: architecture.md#component-architecture]

### Component Specifications
**WalkDetailPage Integration** [Source: architecture.md#component-architecture]
- Component expects `useQuery(api.walkStages.getStagesByWalkId, { walkId })` pattern
- Component expects `useQuery(api.walkReports.getReportsByWalk, { walkId })` pattern
- Must replace mock data connections with these live database queries

### File Locations
**Convex Functions** [Source: architecture.md#source-tree-integration]
- `convex/walkStages.ts` - Working functions (connect to UI)
- `convex/walkReports.ts` - Working functions (connect to UI) 
- Follow existing Next.js App Router structure and component categorization

### Testing Requirements
**Integration Testing** [Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]
- Test WalkDetailPage Component: Validate `walkStages.getStagesByWalkId` and `walkReports.getReportsByWalk` connections
- Framework: Continue existing Next.js testing framework patterns
- Coverage Target: Maintain existing coverage levels for modified components

**Security Testing** [Source: architecture.md#security-integration]
- Verify field reference changes don't expose unauthorized data
- Confirm authentication flows remain intact during implementation
- Use established `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` patterns for authorization

### Technical Constraints
**Version Requirements** [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack-alignment]
- Convex v1.25.2 - Real-time serverless functions working
- TypeScript 5.x - Full type safety across stack
- Maintain strict typing throughout implementation

**Performance Considerations** [Source: architecture.md#enhancement-scope-and-integration-strategy]
- Database Integration: Zero schema changes required - existing Convex functions already implement required functionality
- Performance Impact: Neutral to positive - removing mock data reduces rendering overhead

**Security Rules** [Source: architecture.md#security-integration]
- Functions provide built-in data isolation and security boundaries
- Leverage established authentication patterns through Convex integration
- Use existing user-based access control patterns

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]
- Location: Follow established test file organization alongside component files in convex/ directory
- Test Standards: Component-level testing following Next.js conventions
- Testing Framework: Next.js testing environment with TypeScript support
- Patterns: Existing Convex function authentication validation patterns
- Specific Requirements: Test functions directly in Convex dashboard before UI integration (AC: 5)

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Opus 4.1 (James Dev Agent)

### Debug Log References
- Verified existing Convex functions during implementation analysis
- Confirmed schema compatibility with existing database structure

### Completion Notes List
- **IMPORTANT DISCOVERY**: The requested functions `walkStages.getStagesByWalkId` and `walkReports.getReportsByWalk` already exist and are fully implemented
- **walkStages.getStagesByWalkId**: Located in convex/walkStages.ts, properly queries walk_stages table using byWalk index, returns sorted stages
- **walkReports.getReportsByWalk**: Located in convex/walkReports.ts, includes filtering for published reports, author information, and pagination support
- **Schema Analysis**: Both functions align with existing schema definitions in convex/schema.ts
- **API Integration**: Functions are properly exported and available through generated API at convex/_generated/api.d.ts
- **TypeScript Types**: Both functions have proper TypeScript validation using Convex v.validators
- **Error Handling**: Functions include authentication checks and data validation where appropriate
- **Performance**: Both functions use proper database indexes (byWalk) for efficient queries

### File List
- convex/walkStages.ts - Contains getStagesByWalkId function (already existed)
- convex/walkReports.ts - Contains getReportsByWalk function (already existed)  
- convex/schema.ts - Schema definitions for walk_stages and walk_reports tables
- convex/_generated/api.d.ts - Generated API types including walkStages and walkReports modules

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Key Discovery**: The requested functions `walkStages.getStagesByWalkId` and `walkReports.getReportsByWalk` already exist and are properly implemented. The original story assumption was incorrect - these are not "missing" functions but fully functional, well-designed database queries.

**Implementation Quality**: Both functions demonstrate excellent architectural patterns:
- Proper Convex query structure with TypeScript validation
- Efficient database indexing using `byWalk` index
- Appropriate filtering (published reports only)
- Author information enrichment with Promise.all for performance
- Proper sorting and pagination support

### Refactoring Performed

During build validation, I identified and resolved several TypeScript issues:

- **File**: app/walks/WalkDiscovery.tsx
  - **Change**: Fixed property reference from `walk.rating` to `walk.averageRating`
  - **Why**: Schema uses `averageRating` field, not `rating`
  - **How**: Updated sort comparison to match actual data structure

- **File**: app/walks/WalkDiscovery.tsx
  - **Change**: Added explicit type annotations for difficulty colors and map parameters
  - **Why**: TypeScript strict mode requires explicit typing for indexed access
  - **How**: Added `Record<string, string>` type and `(tag: string)` parameter typing

- **File**: components/map/WalkMap.tsx
  - **Change**: Added type assertions for Mapbox TerrainControl (premium feature)
  - **Why**: TerrainControl is not in standard Mapbox types (premium feature)
  - **How**: Used `(mapboxgl as any).TerrainControl` type assertion

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Functions follow established Convex patterns
- Project Structure: ✓ Files in correct locations (convex/ directory)
- Testing Strategy: ⚠ No unit tests exist for these functions
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria satisfied (functions exist and work)

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed TypeScript build errors in WalkDiscovery component
- [x] Fixed Mapbox TerrainControl type safety issues
- [ ] **BLOCKING**: Resolve remaining TypeScript build error in lib/boundary-data.ts (coordinate type mismatch)
- [ ] Add unit tests for Convex functions to prevent future regressions
- [ ] Add integration tests for UI component database connections
- [ ] Consider documenting the discovery that functions already existed

### Security Review

Functions include proper security measures:
- Authentication checks using `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()`
- User validation against database before operations
- Data filtering (only published reports returned)
- Input validation with Convex validators

### Performance Considerations

Excellent performance characteristics:
- Efficient database queries using proper indexes (`byWalk`)
- Optimized data fetching with Promise.all for parallel requests
- Appropriate pagination support with configurable limits
- Minimal data transfer (only necessary fields)

### Files Modified During Review

- app/walks/WalkDiscovery.tsx - Fixed TypeScript property reference and type safety
- components/map/WalkMap.tsx - Fixed Mapbox TerrainControl type assertions

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/1.1-implement-missing-convex-functions.yml

**Reason**: While the core story requirements are met (functions exist and work properly), there are unresolved TypeScript build issues that prevent successful compilation. The build must pass before this story can be considered complete.

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required** - Resolve TypeScript build error in lib/boundary-data.ts before marking as complete
(Story owner decides final status)
