## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Story 1.1 Context:** After implementing missing Convex backend functions (`walkStages.getStagesByWalkId`, `walkReports.getReportsByWalk`), UI components can now connect to real database functions. This story focuses on fixing the component-level errors that prevent those connections from working.

### Data Models
**Walk Schema Field Alignment** [Source: architecture.md#identified-constraints]
- Database schema uses `walk.averageRating` field name
- UI components incorrectly reference `walk.rating` causing undefined data
- Field reference mismatch must be corrected throughout codebase to display rating data properly

**Geographic Data Integration** [Source: architecture.md#compatibility-requirements]
- Mapbox integration and existing geographic data must continue functioning without interruption
- ScotlandRegionMap component is functional and ready for use
- RegionMap import error prevents walk discovery map from displaying

### API Specifications
**Convex Query Patterns** [Source: architecture.md#component-architecture]
- WalkDetailPage expects: `useQuery(api.walks.getById, { id: walkId })`
- Replace mock data with established query patterns from Story 1.1 implementation
- Maintain existing error handling and loading states for database connections

### Component Specifications
**WalkDiscovery Component** [Source: architecture.md#component-architecture]
- **File Location:** `app/walks/WalkDiscovery.tsx`
- **Import Error:** Line 13 references non-existent `RegionMap` component
- **Correct Import:** `ScotlandRegionMap` from `components/map/ScotlandRegionMap.tsx`
- **Integration Points:** Uses `useQuery(api.walks.getPublishedWalks)` and `useQuery(api.regions.getAllRegions)`

**WalkDetailPage Component** [Source: architecture.md#component-architecture]
- **File Location:** `app/walks/[slug]/WalkDetailPage.tsx`
- **Current State:** Uses mock data instead of live Convex queries
- **Required Integration:** Connect to real database using functions from Story 1.1
- **Dependencies:** WalkMap component, existing UI components

### File Locations
**Component Files** [Source: architecture.md#source-tree-integration]
- `app/walks/WalkDiscovery.tsx` - Fix import on line 13
- `app/walks/[slug]/WalkDetailPage.tsx` - Remove mock data, add Convex queries
- `components/map/ScotlandRegionMap.tsx` - Existing working component to import
- Search pattern: `**/*.tsx` for all `walk.rating` references to update

**Project Structure Alignment** [Source: architecture.md#source-tree-integration]
- Maintain Next.js App Router structure and component categorization
- Follow existing kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components
- Use absolute imports with @/ prefix pattern

### Testing Requirements
**Integration Testing** [Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]
- **WalkDiscovery Component:** Test `ScotlandRegionMap` import resolution and data fetching
- **WalkDetailPage Component:** Validate connections to real database queries work correctly
- **Framework:** Continue existing Next.js testing framework patterns
- **Coverage Target:** Maintain existing coverage levels for modified components

**User Acceptance Testing** [Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]
- Verify walk browsing functionality continues working for existing users
- Confirm map components display properly with existing geographic data
- Test that database field changes don't break existing walk records or user interactions

### Technical Constraints
**Existing System Compatibility** [Source: architecture.md#enhancement-scope-and-integration-strategy]
- Integration Impact: Low-risk surgical changes - no architectural restructuring required
- Performance Impact: Neutral to positive - removing mock data reduces rendering overhead
- API Compatibility: 100% maintained - no Convex function signatures change

**Component Architecture Preservation** [Source: architecture.md#component-architecture]
- Maintain existing component patterns and TailwindCSS styling
- Preserve existing loading states and error handling patterns
- Follow established React 19 functional components with hooks approach

**Security Rules** [Source: architecture.md#security-integration]
- Verify field reference changes don't expose unauthorized data
- Maintain existing authentication context and user access patterns
- Preserve component security boundaries during import fixes

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]
- **Location:** Follow established test file organization alongside component files
- **Test Standards:** Component-level testing following Next.js conventions in project structure
- **Testing Framework:** Next.js testing environment with TypeScript support
- **Patterns:** Existing component render testing and prop validation patterns
- **Specific Requirements:** 
  - Test all affected pages render without console errors (AC: 5)
  - Verify all component imports resolve correctly (AC: 4)
  - Confirm real-time data updates work correctly after mock data removal

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: GOOD with Minor Issues Addressed**

The implementation successfully addresses all acceptance criteria with surgical precision. Components are properly connected to real Convex data sources, imports are correctly resolved, and field references are accurately updated throughout the codebase. The code follows established React patterns and maintains architectural consistency.

### Refactoring Performed

During review, I identified and fixed several quality issues:

- **File**: /home/kyle/claudecode/WalkingScotland/app/walks/[slug]/WalkDetailPage.tsx
  - **Change**: Fixed typo on line 239 from "muted-foreference" to "muted-foreground"
  - **Why**: Corrects TailwindCSS class name for proper styling
  - **How**: Ensures consistent text styling across the component

- **File**: /home/kyle/claudecode/WalkingScotland/components/search/WalkSearch.tsx
  - **Change**: Replaced mock data with real Convex queries using api.walks.getPublishedWalks
  - **Why**: Component was still using hardcoded mock data instead of real database queries
  - **How**: Integrated useQuery hook and updated filtering logic to work with real data structure

- **File**: /home/kyle/claudecode/WalkingScotland/components/search/WalkSearch.tsx
  - **Change**: Added null-safe region name access (walk.region?.name)
  - **Why**: Prevents runtime errors when region data is undefined
  - **How**: Added optional chaining and fallback text "Unknown Region"

- **File**: /home/kyle/claudecode/WalkingScotland/components/search/WalkSearch.tsx
  - **Change**: Updated reviewCount references to reportCount to match schema
  - **Why**: Ensures field names align with actual Convex database schema
  - **How**: Maintains data consistency across UI components

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: âœ“ **Followed React functional component patterns, consistent naming conventions**
- **Project Structure**: âœ“ **Maintained Next.js App Router organization, proper component categorization**

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS â†’ docs/qa/gates/1.2-fix-critical-component-errors.yml

### Recommended Status

**âœ— Changes Required - See unchecked items above**

**Primary Concern: Missing Test Coverage**
While all acceptance criteria are met and code quality is good, the complete absence of automated tests for these critical UI changes presents a significant risk. The story should not be moved to Done without addressing the testing gap.

**Secondary Improvements Recommended but Not Blocking:**
- Error boundary implementation
- Visual regression tests
