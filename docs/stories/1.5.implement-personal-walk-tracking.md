# Story 1.5: Implement Personal Walk Tracking and Statistics

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** registered walker,
**I want** to log my completed walks and track my personal walking statistics,
**so that** I can monitor my progress, achievements, and build a personal walking history.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can mark walks as "completed" from walk detail pages
2. Users can input actual walk completion details (time taken, difficulty experienced, conditions)
3. Dashboard displays real user statistics instead of mock data
4. Users can view their personal walking history and achievements
5. System tracks Scottish walking milestones (Munros climbed, total distance, etc.)
6. Walking activity chart shows actual user activity over time

  - [ ] Subtask 5.5: Implement achievement sharing to social platforms

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
**Story 1.4 Context:** Authentication system simplified and dashboard transformed to walking-focused UI, but using mock data instead of real user statistics.

### Data Architecture Requirements
**User Activity Tracking** [Source: Story 1.4 completion]
- Current `user_stats` table exists in schema but no user input mechanism
- Current dashboard shows fake walking statistics instead of real user data
- Need user-generated walk completion records to populate real statistics

**Database Integration** [Source: convex/schema.ts]
- `walk_reports` table exists for user-generated walk reviews and completions
- `user_stats` table tracks comprehensive metrics but requires user input to populate
- Integration points: walk completion → stats update → dashboard display

### Technical Implementation Requirements
**User Input Flow** [Source: analysis of current architecture]
- Walk detail pages need completion logging functionality
- Form handling for walk completion details (time, conditions, photos)
- Real-time stats calculation when walks are logged
- Dashboard queries need to replace mock data with user statistics

**Performance Considerations** [Source: architecture.md]
- User stats queries must be optimized for dashboard loading
- Walking activity calculations should be cached for better performance
- Large user datasets require pagination and efficient indexing

### User Experience Design
**Progressive Enhancement** [Source: Story 1.4 insights]
- New users start with empty dashboard, need onboarding for first walk logging
- Existing dashboard layout preserved, populated with real data instead of mock
- Achievement system provides motivation for continued walking and logging

**Scottish Walking Domain Integration** [Source: CLAUDE.md]
- Munro, Corbett, and Donald tracking specific to Scottish walking culture
- Distance in kilometers, elevation in meters, following Scottish conventions
- Integration with existing walk data for automatic classification

## Testing Requirements
**User Flow Testing** 
- End-to-end testing of walk completion logging process
- Dashboard data accuracy verification with real user statistics
- Achievement calculation testing with various walking milestone scenarios

**Performance Testing**
- Dashboard loading with varying amounts of user data
- Statistics calculation efficiency with large numbers of completed walks
- Real-time updates when multiple users log walks simultaneously

**Data Integrity Testing**
- Prevent duplicate walk completions for same user/walk combination
- Verify stats calculations remain accurate across all user actions
- Test data migration for users upgrading from mock to real statistics
