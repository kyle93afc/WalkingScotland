# Additional context
review_notes: |
  Code quality is excellent with proper architectural patterns. All acceptance 
  criteria successfully implemented. Minor issues were identified and fixed during 
  review (typo fix, mock data replacement, null safety improvements). 
  
  Primary concern is the complete absence of automated tests for these UI changes, 
  which affects reliability validation. While the changes are low-risk surgical 
  updates, proper test coverage would ensure long-term maintainability.

refactoring_performed:
  - "Fixed TailwindCSS class typo in WalkDetailPage"
  - "Replaced WalkSearch mock data with real Convex queries"
  - "Added null-safe region name handling"
  - "Aligned field names with database schema"
