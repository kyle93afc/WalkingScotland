Steps lead down to the beach here, and a very short distance to the right is the Tobar na Slainte or the Well of Health. This consists of a small stone-trough built on a spring, but damaged by high tides. According to local folklore water from the well, if 'silvered' by the addition of a silver coin to a ladel-full, could cure one who had been cursed by the 'Evil Eye' or ill-luck. The cure only worked if the person who brought them the water made the journey to and from the well without speaking to another soul - so if you've met anyone who didn't return your greeting, they may have an excuse."

One is close by the road climbing from the west end. It is easy to spot as it has had a glass enclosure built round it to protect it from erosion; the stone dates from 780AD and the carvings are exquisite. There is another fine stone just east of Shandwick at Hilton of Cadboll."

The path straight ahead was a detour to reach a viewpoint for the Middle Falls where the Moness burn flows through a ravine - but this path has been closed following a landslide, hopefully it will eventually be repaired.
