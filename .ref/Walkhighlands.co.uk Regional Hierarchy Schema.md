# Walkhighlands.co.uk Regional Hierarchy Schema

I've analyzed the walkhighlands.co.uk website structure and extracted the complete hierarchical organization of Scotland's walking regions. The site organizes content into **26 main regions** (18 mainland + 8 island regions), with **6 regions containing subdivisions** for more granular geographic organization.

## Key Findings

**Aberdeenshire Structure** (as you specifically mentioned):

- Main Region: **Aberdeenshire**
- Subdivisions:
    - **Banff and Buchan** (coastal area including towns like Banff, Fraserburgh, Peterhead)
    - **Huntly, Alford and Inverurie: Gordon** (inland area)
    - **Stonehaven and Lower Deeside** (southern coastal area)
    - **City of Aberdeen** (urban area)


## Complete Regional Hierarchy

The schema includes:

**Mainland Regions with Subdivisions:**

- **Aberdeenshire**: 4 subdivisions
- **Cairngorms and Aviemore**: 6 subdivisions
- **Argyll, Oban \& Bute**: 8 subdivisions
- **Loch Lomond \& Trossachs**: 4 subdivisions
- **Borders**: 4 subdivisions

**Single-Level Regions:**

- 13 mainland regions without subdivisions
- 8 island regions
- 7 long-distance walking routes


## Files for Claude Code Integration

The CSV file provides a flattened, database-friendly format showing region types, main regions, sub-regions, and descriptions. The markdown documentation provides comprehensive details about the hierarchical structure, geographic coverage, and implementation suggestions for building a modern competitor to walkhighlands.co.uk.

This schema structure will allow your Next.js application to organize walking routes geographically, implement proper navigation hierarchies, and provide users with intuitive regional browsing similar to the existing walkhighlands site but with your modern UI approach.
