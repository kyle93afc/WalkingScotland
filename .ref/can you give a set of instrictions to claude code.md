# can you give a set of instrictions to claude code on how to get beatuficul soup to get all the routes from [https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/](https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/)

To instruct Claude code for using BeautifulSoup to extract all walking routes from https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/, here is a set of clear, structured steps to follow for web scraping:

## Instructions to Claude Code for BeautifulSoup Web Scraping

1. **Import Required Libraries**
    - Use `requests` to fetch web page content.
    - Use `BeautifulSoup` from `bs4` to parse HTML content.
2. **Fetch the Main Page HTML**
    - Request the URL `https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/` to get the homepage HTML.
3. **Locate Routes Section**
    - Identify where the walks or routes are listed. (Inspect the page to find HTML elements like links or lists representing route collections.)
    - On this site, zones for walks likely appear as links grouped in a container (e.g., an area list or menu) or under specific `<div>` or `<ul>` tags with distinctive classes or IDs.
4. **Extract Area Links**
    - Parse all links (`<a>` tags) pointing to area pages containing walks (like "Sutherland \& Caithness," "Ullapool, Assynt," etc.).
    - These links serve as entry points to lists of walks in each area.
5. **Visit Each Area Page**
    - For each area link collected, send a new request to get the list of walks/routes in that area.
6. **Parse Walk Routes from Area Pages**
    - On each area's page, find the HTML elements hosting individual routes (likely anchor tags with route names).
    - Extract route name and URL for each walk.
7. **Collect \& Output Data**
    - Store route name and URL in a structured format (e.g., list of dictionaries).
    - Optionally, save to CSV or JSON for further use.

### Example Pseudocode Instructions for Claude

```python
# 1. Import libraries
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# 2. Get homepage content
main_url = "https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/"
response = requests.get(main_url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

# 3. Find all area links for walk routes
# Example selector: container with class/id that holds area links (inspect real page for accuracy)
area_links = soup.select('selector-for-area-links a')  # replace selector

routes = []

# 4. Loop through area links
for link in area_links:
    area_url = main_url + link['href'] if link['href'].startswith('/') else link['href']
    area_resp = requests.get(area_url)
    area_soup = BeautifulSoup(area_resp.text, 'html.parser')

    # 5. Find all walk route links on area page
    walk_links = area_soup.select('selector-for-walk-links a')  # replace selector

    # 6. Extract name and link for each walk
    for walk in walk_links:
        walk_name = walk.text.strip()
        walk_url = main_url + walk['href'] if walk['href'].startswith('/') else walk['href']
        routes.append({'name': walk_name, 'url': walk_url})

# 7. Output routes list
return routes
```

If needed, the exact CSS selectors for steps 3 and 5 can be identified by inspecting the HTML structure of https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/ and its linked pages.

This instruction set gives Claude clear steps: fetch homepage, find areas, iterate areas, pull walks on each, collect data. This approach leverages BeautifulSoup's parsing and CSS selector abilities in 2025-style web scraping.
