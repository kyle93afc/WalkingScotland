Among the many legends associated with D\u00f9n Scaith are those recounted in Macpherson's 'Ossian' concerning the adventures of the Irish folk hero Cu Chulainn, who came here when he first landed in Skye. One tradition tells how he came here to learn the marshal arts of war from the warrior queen 'Sgathaich', whose home this was. The castle is reached over a gully bridged by two walls which flanked a drawbridge, whose pivot holes are still visible on the far side. With the drawbridge missing the dangers of entering the castle can be clearly seen. On the far side of the bridge a door would have opened onto a flight of steps leading up between walls to the castle."
